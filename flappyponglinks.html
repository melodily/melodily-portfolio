<a href="FlappyPongV8/FlappyPongV8.html">V8 (Impt)</a>: <br />
- Goes from slow to faster (is the speed progression ok? too slow? too fast? what about the speed of the paddle?)<br />
- Default min force implemented. Usable force now covers a larger part of the bar. <br />
- Paddle slimmed down to distinguish between walls and paddle <br />
- Transparent yellow part shows optimal force to use (Is it clear what it's for?) <br /><br />
<a href="FlappyPongV9/FlappyPongV9.html">V9</a>: Tapping multiple times for charge (No more hold to charge) <br /><br />
<a href="FlappyPongV10/FlappyPongV10.html">V10</a>: Tapping multiple times for moving and charge (How do you find the camera motion? Is this better than previously?)<br /><br />
<a href="FlappyPongV11/FlappyPongV11.html">V11</a>: When ball lands, charge force stays the same - use up/down or w/a to adjust more or less. <br />
