			Jiku Video Player is an Android application that enables users to track objects of 
			interest in videos, based on a combination of computation and crowd-sourcing. A lower
			resolution is sufficient most of the time for a video, especially one for a screen as small
			as a mobile device. Sometimes, however, you might want to view objects in the video in greater
			detail, for example in security camera footage, and hence want to render that particular area in
			higher resolution. 
			<br />
			<br />
			I developed this application and its user interface, given the tracking points of objects of interest
			that was pre-generated by another program, as well as the backend program of decoding the video in various
			resolutions. This was done for my Final Year Project in National University of Singapore.

				VoxeLab is a game prototyping software that allows you to plan out a game quickly by using
				voxels to build game worlds. You need not manipulate meshes to generate 3D worlds,
				allowing you to focus more on the game mechanics with respect to the environment. VoxeLab
				also aims to provide game-makers with a clear idea of the metrics of the in-game environment,
				allowing you to test your game prototype. You will be able to manipulate voxels with the
				features of a paint software, add basic game elements and test the prototype.
				<br />
				<br />
				VoxeLab can be used in 2 modes -- Create Mode and Game Mode. In Create Mode, you can
				design, build and edit 3D worlds and game levels using brushes, and group structures of voxels
				into objects to support object‐based modelling. In Game Mode, you can edit basic game
				elements (such as jump-height and gravity) so as to test your 3D world as a game environment.

				Item Genie seeks to enable better gaming choices by players by allowing comparisons between items'

				of the game. The UI part focuses on facilitating these comparisons through a graphical manner
				and will provide functions to sort, search and selectively focus on specific items and
				attributes for side-by-side comparison.
				This will be based on backend data of all the in-game items and their properties.

				Entered for the programming application of SUTD's Summer Gamelab Internship 2014, Asteroids on Crack is a game
				that gives the traditional asteroids game a twist. The application provided us with skeleton code that included
				stationary asteroids and a useless ship, and asked that we add motion, rotation and shooting abilities to the ship, as well
				as decide what to do when the ship goes out of bounds of the game map. It also required that we add a new gameplay feature 
				in order to make it fun. 
				<br /><br />
				Thus, besides making everything move and adding the start and end screens, lights, sound and a mesh to the ship, I added
a surprise gift feature that pops out when the player destroys an asteroid. 
Traditional asteroid games emphasise on the score through the number of asteroids 
the player has destroyed, but I thought that competing for high scores might not 
be everyone's cup of tea, including mine. Instead, as I was brainstorming for gifting
ideas for my boyfriend, I had a brainwave: everyone loves presents, especially those
which contents they don't know. Why make another mindless destruction game? Why not
a game that capitalises on the thrill of discovery and the inclination to hoard? Every
asteroid destroyed contains a surprise that pops up through scaling, and that gift 
belongs to the player till the end of the game, displayed prominently as his loot. 
The traditional challenge of the game still exists -- the player still has to dodge
and shoot moving asteroids. But now with the virtual gifts that are contained in 
each asteroid, this harks all the way back to a child's love of opening wrapped gifts,
under a christmas tree or not.

				Pinata Explosion! is a touch based game designed for mall terminals.
				Players  are presented with a Pinata that constantly moves,

				Players then scramble to toss as many candies as they can into the provided basket --

mini gods treading on water. <br />
I raise my camera<br />

the tide swells in, arching its back<br />

"Hurry!" my friend hollers<br />

"Don't let the sea take you!" <br />
so I lift my knees up high <br />
like an Olympic hurdler, <br />
slamming seawater on my dress<br />
as I slap my way across. <br />
The water recedes, and I emerge<br /> 
on the other side, safe <br />
and shaking with laughter.<br />

			<div class="writing-container">	
Teach me how to find you, dear,<br />
teach me the lessons<br />
you have yet to teach anyone. First<br />
start with the basics: arm me<br />
with a street-map, bold red marker from 'Where I am'<br /> 
tracing hallways, turning corners,<br />
eventually resting, panting slightly,<br />
at the cross which marks your spot. <br />
Give me a map<br />
big enough to mark you,<br />
and then me. I might still get lost,<br />
1cm to 300m too big a scale <br />
to navigate the labyrinth between us.<br />
Give me time. Give me<br />
more clues&#8212; if this was a library<br />
which shelf would I find you at, absorbed?<br />
Would you rather curl up with one book, or <br />
nudge several out at once, then settle beside <br />
with your hoard? <br />
At the cinema, my eyes<br />
adjusting to the darkness: should I scan the aisles first,<br />
or split the sea of seats in the middle <br />
with my probing periscope?<br />
As I get better, award me with a remote sensor&#8212;<br />
program it to detect the frequency of your thoughts, so,<br />
walking down a corridor, if it should<br />
beep with a frenzy<br />
I could pause, to<br />
lean my ear on the muffled wall. Tune my ear:<br />
straighten my bent 'F'-sharp, soften my harsh 'A'<br />
that I might not spoil your music. Finally:<br />
if I have learnt well (but never enough)<br />
permit me to enter, to<br />
whisk the pages off <br />
your score, and then,<br />
with the empty page, <br />
ink a bar that scrawls out of the page borders<br />
to make a music only we can find.<br />

In the impact before the shatter<br />

In the impact before the shatter<br />

Recede and rush I find your ear<br />
The lobes they yield like wheat like fur<br />
And my tongue it runs a murmur<br />
<br />
Your hands they wrap my neck my collar<br />
A push and you have me down under<br />
In the impact before the shatter<br />

Close eyes call skin your lips they cover<br />
A cloak each stitch my mouth they hover<br />
And my tongue it runs a murmur<br />

My arms tighten a loop a shackle<br />
Your body a cage and I prisoner<br />
In the impact before the shatter<br />
And my tongue it runs a murmur<br />

				<h4>On finding a body in the water tank</h4>

			<div class="writing-container">	
				"Frothy and discoloured" was how<br />
the newspaper described their tap water one morning.<br />
They would have used it for several things before the discovery,<br />
routine things: rinsing their mouths, a wake-up shower,<br />
a bowl of soup. At this groggy hour<br />
the body could almost be<br />
alive: the tank<br />
expanding, contracting<br />
redly, propelling blood cells<br />
to this household, that. The block of flats<br />
breathing. Twitching.<br />
<br />
This morning my father fetched the net<br />
hanging by the side of his fish tank,<br />
made a clean scoop. I wonder<br />
how the discus must feel, swimming<br /> 
under the shadow of their dead friend.<br />
Drifting by the surface, one glassy eye<br />
upturned, towards the dry world <br />
it cannot experience, the other<br />
observing quietly the inhabitants. <br />
It could almost <br />
just be a fallen leaf.<br />

Carriage atop carriage the conveyor belt<br />

the wind whooshing in a rustle of skirts<br />
a swerve of bitten gasp<br />
a rumble of tracks in thumping<br /> 
movement<br />

, moves slow breaths and the tick,<br /> 
tick of watches.<br />

Outside each kitty flap the green-lit "EXIT"<br />
outlines a silhouette <br />

a loaded elevator stops <br />

					Once you kept flowers, gave vases to them, forgot<br />
vases stayed long after flowers died. When the house was new<br />
you were happy to be guided by lamps, feigning forgetfulness<br />
<br />
around the furniture you arranged. You forgot<br />
me. Thought that once given, <br />
I would never return.<br />
<br />
But I did, drop by torrent. At first<br />
in minutes: the peak hour traffic, the extended<br />
appointments. I hid in your dinners, slowed,<br />
<br />
had to be heated. You tended to your flowers,<br />
gave them sun. Restaurant: his calls, <br />
apologetic, your orders to the waiter:<br />
<br />
the set meal for one.<br />
The candles burned. I came back,<br />
put them out, kissed your eyelids; you rose from sleep,<br />
<br />
eyes stinging, listening to the darkness<br />
of the house. I pooled in your pots,<br />
drowned your flowers. You threw them away.<br />
<br />
I made my home in your ransacked laundry. You tried<br />
to hang them dry, but the creases<br />
would not allow. I surged, took over<br />
<br />
your house, ran your watercolour dress. Why resist,<br />
sweetheart? You sobbed, <br />
felt me clogging your lungs. You stopped lighting<br /> 
<br />
the candles. Of course. Saw me in every pocket,<br />
thought me a fly when you poured yourself a drink.<br />
I am the drink. Now it is night.<br />
<br />
Give yourself to me. Now your body<br />
a meandering shadow, earrings<br />
glinting the moon's light.<br />

				<i>My heart sleeps without waking in the arms of sadness.<br /> 
--from </i>La Vie En Rose<br />
<br />
Life goes on.<br /> 
May is the month of heat and thunderstorms.<br />
I bring Elaine to the zoo <br />
but all the animals are hiding in the shade.<br />
Half an hour in <br />
we sit dumbly in front of the penguins,<br /> 
envying their wallpaper glaciers.<br />
Elaine understands, makes few demands.<br /> 
When we get home I prepare dinner,<br />
she washes up. As usual <br />
I cook too much, or eat too little.<br />
The gods have left too much hair <br />
in their bathroom drain; no air<br />
comes through to us. <br />
Back in my room <br />
my fingers fidget across the keyboard,<br /> 
as if I could propel a breeze with that.<br />
I talk to old friends, make new ones. <br />
My words sink down like dregs.<br />
At night I loosen the curtains, <br />
crank the fan to a higher speed.<br />
As I drift off the sky crunches into rain.<br /> 
Dimly I feel the wind <br />
beating against the windows,<br /> 
curtains flung across rattling grills.<br /> 
My heart sleeps without waking. <br />
I have dreams of you. In the morning<br />
I rise for work, quietly leave <br />
my sleeping heart.<br />

my roommate stands in front<br />

I wish I could draw my eyes<br />

A woman stands on the corner<br /> 
of Laurel and Front,<br />
<br />
Her ear bobbing<br />
as she examines the inside<br />
of her takeout box,<br />
<br />
Gives the flap a last lick<br />
before dropping it in the bin.<br />
<br />
<h4>The carpet has been stealing</h4>
How many hairpins have dropped<br />
on the grey carpet?<br />

Today I picked up yet another,<br />
gleaming too much<br />
to camouflage.<br />
